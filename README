Release Notes
=============
see CHANGES file for detailed log

_Restyled UI_
The UI has been re-factored to have a common look and fee. Additionally most 
of the icons are now loaded at runtime. That means you can change colors and icons at 
runtime without changing the source code. 
More info: http://openmeetings.apache.org/themes-and-branding.html

_New Calendar_
The calendar was completely re-factored and got a new UI that was build from 
scratch that also adds some new functions. For example it is possible now to password 
protect invitations send via the calendar. Further the timezone handling has been 
re-factored and there is now also a SOAP/REST API to handle calendar Events 
( http://openmeetings.apache.org/SoapRestAPI.html )

_Integration with Asterisk_
The application contains now modules to directly integrate OpenMeetings with Asterisk 
for SIP/VoIP integration. It enables you to dial in as well as dial out of conference 
room to SIP or landlane phones. 
More info: http://openmeetings.apache.org/voip-sip-integration.html

_Install/Backup/Import via command line_
 Additionally to the Web-Interface you can now do all basic operations via the console. 
 Just cd to your OpenMeetings installation directory and type “admin” and you will see 
 all options available (OpenMeetings service should be shut down while doing those operations)

_Using SWF10 for Video Components_
All audio/video related components now use SWF10 for broadcasting and receiving 
audio and video signals. That makes it possible to use for example the echo cancellation 
feature build in the SWF10 Flash Player.

There are a lot more improvements for example to recording, screen sharing and new layout 
options. To see the full list please review our Release Notes for Version 2.0:

There are also new Integration Plugins available!

_Integration into Atlassian Jira_

https://blogs.apache.org/openmeetings/entry/jira_integration_apache_openmeetings_demo

_Integration into Atlassian Confluence_
Same for Atlassian Confluence Wiki, you can watch 
a demo here: https://blogs.apache.org/openmeetings/entry/demo_video_about_upcoming_atlassian

_Important Changes_
OpenOffice service does not need any more to be started. But you have 
to set the path to OpenOffice (or LibreOffice) and JODConverter tools in 
OpenMeetings configuration. OpenMeetings (and JODConverter) will start and stop the 
OpenOffice service when they need it.
If you are using MySQL: MySQL driver is no more part of the distribution due to license restrictions. 
You will need to download the JConnector Driver on your own, see:
http://openmeetings.apache.org/MySQLConfig.html

_Upgrading from Version 1.9 or prior_
To update from an old version of OpenMeetings to 2.x 
you should use the integrated Backup and Import tool that exists since around Version 1.3.
