			<subsection name="Before you start">
				<ul>
					<li>Make sure that you have set utf8 as
						default/server-character-set in your MySQL configuration (my.cnf)
						before you start the installation process of OpenMeetings!
					</li>
					<li>
						make sure MySQL is listening on TCP/IP connections!
						<br />
						To verify if MySQL connection is working: OpenMeetings will
						automatically create all tables in the database and all tables
						should have utf8 as encoding/collation!
					</li>
					<li>If you encounter issues, you can drop the db again and delete
						the file $red5/webapps/openmeetings/conf/install.xml and then run
						the web based installer again
					</li>
				</ul>
