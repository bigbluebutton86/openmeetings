		<section name="How to Build a Release of OpenMeetings">

			<subsection name="Required tools">

				<div>
					<p>To build a binary release of OpenMeetings you need: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Sun JDK6</li>
						<li>Apache ANT (minimum) 1.8.3</li>
						<li>
							SVN Command line client (Subversion 1.7 required!)
							<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html" target="_BLANK"
								rel="nofollow">http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html</a>
						</li>
						<li>A text editor</li>
						<li>You need to be online! The build process actively downloads
							needed libraries and dependencies.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Prepare your Apache ID">

				<div>
					Every release package must be signed with a PGP/GPG key.
					<br />
					So if you want to release a package your Apache Id must be
					connected with a PGP key!
					<br />
					<br />
					You might follow:
					<br />
					<a
						href="http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html#security-and-pgp"
						target="_blank">http://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html#security-and-pgp
					</a>
					<br />
					<br />
					In short:
					<br />
					Create PGP key pairs (private + public) (and I recommend creating a
					Revoke Cert)
					<br />
					Upload the public key (either bei using the PGP Tool that you use
					to create the key) or by using the web form to:
					<a href="http://pgp.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://pgp.mit.edu/
					</a>
					<br />
					Add the fingerprint string (something like "BF13 CF11 F9C9 0CBE
					4413 09AB 0055 16BF 93A3 0395") to your profile at
					<a href="http://id.apche-org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">id.apche-org
					</a>
					<br />
					Wait for 6-8 hours, the server will search for a public key based
					on your fingerprint, if success it will create a file with your
					name at:
					<br />
					<a href="https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/">https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/</a>
					<br />
					<br />
					If that is "success" then add your key to:
					<br />
					<a
						href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openmeetings/project/KEYS">https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openmeetings/project/KEYS
					</a>
					<br />
					and follow the instructions in the file.
					<br />
				</div>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Step1 - Prepare files">
				<p>
					Check that all files:
					<br />
					LICENSE, NOTICE, DISCLAIMER, CHANGELOG, README
					<br />
					are up to date and refer to the right version.
				</p>

				<p>
					Create a TAG of the SVN tree that you would like to release
				</p>

				<p>Get the source from your TAG: </p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					svn checkout
					https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openmeetings/$TREE/$BRANCHORTAG/
					<br />
					$TREE and $BRANCHORTAG should be replaced with your new TAG
				</div>

				<p>Edit the file build.properties</p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					project.status=SNAPSHOT
				</div>
				<p>to</p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					project.status=RELEASE
				</div>
				<p>Run the command: </p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					ant dist-release
				</div>
				<p>Test building the source on windows and OSx or Linux</p>
				<p>Test running the binary's</p>
				<p>Create MD5 checksums</p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					#On OSX you might use this command to make a MD5 checksum and store
					it to a file
					<br />
					md5 -r apache-openmeetings-XXX-src.zip >
					apache-openmeetings-XXX-src.zip.md5
				</div>
				<p>
					Create signatures with the your KEY for every file, the KEY must be
					available at:
					<br />
					<a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/openmeetings/KEYS">http://www.apache.org/dist/incubator/openmeetings/KEYS
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>Upload the build artefacts to your public_html in your home
					directory at people.apache.org
				</p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					#On OSX you might use this command to upload the file
					<br />
					scp apache-openmeetings-XXXX.zip
					sebawagner@people.apache.org:~/public_html/
				</div>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Step2 - VOTE and RESULT emails">
				<p>
					Send a "VOTE" to the developer mailing list including links to
					release artefacts.
					<br />
					A VOTE always contains two parts:
					<br />
					Send an email to the developer mailing list with the subject line:
					<br />
					[VOTE] Apache OpenMeetings x.xx release
					<br />
					An example for such an email:
					<a
						href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-openmeetings-dev/201207.mbox/%3CCACeMiA9dXXMnxA3EhJVPGhpvO4z2cLNqHVP7uOhSHT8e_vHoFQ%40mail.gmail.com%3E">example Vote email</a>
					<br />
					Forward (Not CC) this Vote email to: private@incubator.apache.org
					<br />
					<br />
					After the vote is over, send a "RESULT" email to the list with the
					subject line:
					<br />
					[RESULT][VOTE] Apache OpenMeetings x.xx release
					<br />
					An example for such an email:
					<a
						href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-openmeetings-dev/201207.mbox/%3CCACeMiA-ibo6fGCbnLjJX9H5H2kFGDVJRMfxPyMtzWzCWNi%2BpOg%40mail.gmail.com%3E">example Result email</a>
					<br />
					Forward (Not CC) this RESULT VOTE email to:
					private@incubator.apache.org
					<br />
					<br />
					After the Vote was successful on the Developer mailing list,
					you
					need organize a vote on the general list:
					general@incubator.apache.org
					<br />
					The vote on the general list has the same process, first a VOTE
					email, then a RESULT email.
					<br />
					You need at least 3 IPMC votes for the release. You can summarize
					the IPMC votes from both votes (dev + general).
				</p>

			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Step3 - Distribute and announce">
				<p>If VOTEs positive: Upload the release </p>
				<div class="xmlcode">
					The distribution upload location
					(www.apache.org/dist)
					for all Apache projects is the
					/www/www.apache.org/dist directory on
					people.apache.org. Each
					project owns a directory within dist.
				</div>
				<p>
					Our distribution directory is:
					<br />
					/www/www.apache.org/dist/incubator/openmeetings
					<br />
					each version should have a subfolder within this directory matching
					the name of the release:
					<br />
					for example 2.0
					<br />
					Make sure the the files/folders in the section
					/www/www.apache.org/dist/incubator/openmeetings have the proper
					rights,
					see:
					<a
						href="http://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html#distribution-permissions"
						target="_BLANK">http://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html#distribution-permissions
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Wait 24 hours (until all Apache mirrors have synced the packages)
					and send an announcement to the mailing list + blog and any other
					channel.
				</p>
				<p>
					Email announcements should have the subject line:
					<br />
					[ANNOUNCE] Apache OpenMeetings x.xx [Incubating] released
				</p>
				<p>
					Add a section to
					<a href="downloads.html">downloads</a>
					website.
					<br />
					Make sure that the binary packages are linked using the mirror URL
					as base path (
					<b>not</b>
					www.apache.org/dist):
					<br />
					Mirror URL:
					<a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/openmeetings/">http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/openmeetings/
					</a>
