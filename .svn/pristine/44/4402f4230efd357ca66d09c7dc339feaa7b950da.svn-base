		<section name="Apache Derby Configuration">

			<p>
				OpenMeetings default configuration is to use Apache Derby.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is recommended for production environments and high
				availibility to change to an usual relational database like MySQL,
				Postgres or DB2.
			</p>
			<p>
				For more information about Apache Derby see
				<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">http://db.apache.org/derby/</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				There is a sample configuration for Apache Derby that ships with
				every release in:
				<br />
				/webapps/openmeetings/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/derby_persistence.xml
			</p>

			<p>
				If you encounter issues, you can drop the db again and delete the
				file /webapps/openmeetings/conf/install.xml and then run the web
				based installer again
			</p>
