Verity Readme and license document
December 29, 2003

This document refers to the TrueType font family Verity ("Font"), included in the same directory as this document.  Verity11 was the default font for applications created with Laszlo Presentation Server v2.0 (LPS) and is used by the Laszlo component set.

The Font includes eight Ultra Pixel Fonts. Ultra Pixel Fonts are TrueType fonts composed of greyscale images encoded into glyph outlines. The images were created by rendering Bitstream's font Vera, designed by Jim Lyles, on an OS X based Macintosh. This combination ensured a quality font of consistent appearance across all platforms. Verity must be used at 8 point in OpenLaszlo to achieve pixel reproduction.

Unlike Vera, no derivative works or modifications may be made to Verity, nor may it be offered for sale. The Font may be included as part of a commercial or non-commercial distribution, only in conjunction with licensed use of the OpenLaszlo server software.

Ultra Pixel Font encoding is patent pending. It is the most compatible and reliable method of grayscale pixel control in outline font formats and may be licensed from TRUTH in Design, its inventor and sole licensor. Please contact licensing@truthindesign.com for more information.

Fonts developed with the UPF method are available from www.ultrafonts.com, a commercial service of TRUTH in Design.

THE FONT IS PROVIVED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR
OTHER RIGHT.  IN NO EVENT SHALL LASZLO BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR
OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE,
ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OF INABILITY TO USE THE FONT.
