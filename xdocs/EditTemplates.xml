			<p>
				All language string should be localized and stored in the language
				section. You have a full featured language editor with every
				installation of OpenMeetings, check out the
				<a href="LanguageEditor.html">LanguageEditor</a>
				.
			</p>
			<p>
				To lookup the labelids in the GUI you can simply run OpenMeetings
				client with the debug enabled. That way every text-string has the
				labelid in brackets additionally in the textfield. To start the
				client in debug mode just add the param ?swf=maindebug.swf8.swf to
				the URL. Example:
				<a href="http://localhost:5080/openmeetings/?swf=maindebug.swf8.swf"
					rel="nofollow">http://localhost:5080/openmeetings/?swf=maindebug.swf8.swf</a>

		<section name="Changing layout, adding footers in emails">

			<p>If you would like to change the standard email layout or add for
				example some footer in every email you have to change the email
				templates.
			</p>
			<p>To do that: Stop the Red5/OpenMeetings-Service Goto:
				$Red5_HOME/webapps/openmeetings/WEB-INF/lib/openmeetings-templates.jar
				Unzip: openmeetings-templates.jar (this is a usual ZIP file, you can
				rename it to openmeetings-templates.zip unzip, edit the files, zip
				it again and rename it to openmeetings-templates.jar)
			</p>
			<p>
				In openmeetings-templates.jar there are all template files. They
				have the file extension .vm (VM stands for velocity-template). After
				you have done your changes you need to (re)start the
				Red5/OpenMeetings
				-Service so that changes are online.
