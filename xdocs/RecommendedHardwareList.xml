		<section name="Cameras">
			We recommend the following cameras:
			<ul>
				<li>Logitech QuickCam Sphere AF</li>
				<li>Logitech QuickCam E3500</li>
				<li>Samsung Pleomax PWC-7100</li>
				<li>Genius Look320S</li>
				<li>Integrated Lenovo 3000 n100</li>
				<li>Skypemate WC-103M</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section name="Headsets">
			The recommended headset model (i.e. headphones with microphone) is:
			<ul>
				<li>Logitech Clear Chat Style</li>
			</ul>
			Also the following headsets showed good results:
			<ul>
				<li>ClearChat PC Wireless (helps to suppress echo)</li>
				<li>Logitech USB Desktop Microphone - Mikrophon (good sound, but bad echo cancellation)</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Note for Mac OS X users:</b> The build-in microphone normally has quite good quality and echo cancellation, so Mac OS X users often do not even require a headset.
		</section>
		<section name="Speakerphones">
			When several people participate from the same location, we recommend using the following speakerphone models:
			<ul>
				<li>Phoenix Audio Quattro2 USB Speakerphone MT301 (a single microphone + speakers can be used even with 20-30 people sitting in a room)</li>
				<li>Phoenix DUET Executive</li>
				<li>Jabra SPEAK410</li>
				<li>Plantronics MCD 100M</li>
				<li>Integrated Lenovo 3000 n100</li>
