		<section name="Performance Tuning">

			<p>To use the optimum of performance from your server there is a
				start-script for red5 available that does some basic settings in the
				JVM. It is called red5-highperf.sh. It is recommended to use that
				script for production and high-load scenarios.
			</p>
			<div class="xmlcode">
				#!/bin/bash
				<br />
				<br />
				if [ -z "$RED5_HOME" ]; then export RED5_HOME=.; fi
				<br />
				<br />
				# Previous option set
				<br />
				export JAVA_OPTS="-Xrs -Xms512M -Xmx1024M -Xss128K -XX:NewSize=256m
				-XX:SurvivorRatio=16 -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=20
				-XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
				-Xverify:none"
				<br />
				<br />
				# start Red5
				<br />
				echo "Setting Hi Performance Options"
				<br />
				exec $RED5_HOME/red5.sh >> $RED5_HOME/log/jvm.stdout 2>&amp;1 &amp;
				<br />
			</div>

			<p>You have to exclude the "-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC" param from the
				default red5-highperf.sh to make it functional! However if you are a
				performance expert you might also play with the values to find
				perfect matches for your use-case.
			</p>
