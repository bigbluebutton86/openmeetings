		<section name="LDAP and Active Directory Integration">

			<p> In: $RED5_HOME/webapps/openmeetings/conf<br/>

				you will find sample configurations for LDAP and Active Directory. The
				nature of those Directory Servers are that they are individual for
				every organization, so you have to modify of course at least the
				path to your user-base et cetera.<br/>
				<br/>
				To activate any of those configurations you have to login into
				OpenMeetings, goto Administration > Ldap.

				</a>
			
			<p>
				Import is that you configure LDAP_SEARCH_PATH so that it points to the node of your directory server that contains the users
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you have multiple search paths you can either try to define a search path that points to multiple nodes or define multiple ldap configurations.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Successful integration is also reported with Novell eDirectory
			</p>
			
			<p>
				You can configure multiple domains or different user-paths in the Administration of OpenMeetings.
