				The Text in the Administration>Backup section actually just says
				it
				all. The backup contains users, rooms, organizations and
				appointements (Invitations and Reminders are NOT included in the
				Backup and Reminders will not be send again!). The Backup contains
				also all uploaded Files and Documents and will re-import them again.

				Max Upload Size is 1000 MB.

		<section name="Upgrading OpenMeetings from command line">
			<p>
				<i>You need OpenMeetings 2.x or later to have the command line interface (CLI) 
					feature available
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				Alternatively to the Web-Installer you can also export and import
				via the command line. <br/>
				<b>You should shutdown the Red5-Service while doing CLI export or import operations</b>
				<br />
				Cd to your red5-home directory, type "admin" and hit enter. You will
				get options available.
				<br />
				<br />
				A typical export would be:
				<br />
				<tt>admin -b -file backup_today.zip</tt>
				<br />
				<br />
				A typical import would be:
				<br />
				<tt>admin -r -file backup_yesterday.zip</tt>
				<br />
				<br />
				You can also combine the installation with a backup, that way you
				will create exactly the user table that existed in the backup.
				<br />
				A typical install from backup would be:
				<br />
				<tt>admin -i -file backup_yesterday.zip</tt>
				<br/>
				please see
				<a href="CommandLineAdmin.html" target="_BLANK" rel="nofollow">Command Line Admin
				</a>
				for more options
