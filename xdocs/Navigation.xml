		<section name="Changing the main navigation">

			<p>To customize the main menu (for example remove entries or changing
				the order) you can edit the tables:  </p>
			<ul>
				<li>navimain </li>
				<li>naviglobal </li>
				<li>navisub (currently not in use) </li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				You need to make sure that you
				<strong>restart red5 after doing changes to the database</strong>
				, there is a database cache, so changes might not take affect as
				long as you did not restart.
			</p>
