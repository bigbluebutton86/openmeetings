		<section name="Default Configuration">

			<p>FFMPEG has a change in its API (possibly since GIT revision
				88bfe4518)
			</p>
			<p>Since Version 1.9.x of OpenMeetings: By default OpenMeetings
				expects you to have a new version of FFMPEG on your OpenMeetings
				server installed and it will use the new API style to communicate
				with FFMPEG.
			</p>

		</section>

		<section name="Switching to old FFMPEG API">
		
			<p>
				If you want to switch to the old style you can change that using the
				config key:
				<tt>use.old.style.ffmpeg.map.option</tt>
			</p>
			<p>
				Set this value to
				<tt>1</tt>
				to have the old params in the API call to FFMPEG.
